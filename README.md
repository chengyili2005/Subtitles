A quick Python command-line script for generating subtitles.

Credits:
- Some of the code was borrowed from this [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWrRJx2wdWc) which does a similar task.

Set-up info:
- Clone the repository
- Download [arial.ttf](https://github.com/kavin808/arial.ttf) and drag into cloned directory
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Best used through VSCode for easier text editting

Usage: `python3 main.py [input_video_path] [output_directory]`
- Half-way through the script, it will prompt you to make some edits to the subtitles based off of your judgement.
- Lines can be found in output/[input_file].txt (Make sure to save the file before continuing the script).

A quick Python command-line script for generating subtitles.

Credits:
- This script contains code borrowed from a YouTube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWrRJx2wdWc

Usage: python3 main.py [input_video_path] [output_directory]
- Best used through VSCode for easier text editting
- Half-way through the script, it will prompt you to make some edits to the subtitles based off of your judgement.
- Lines can be found in output/[input_file].txt (Make sure to save the file before continuing the script)
